# password-generator

During this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a password generator that spews out random characters that asre based on the user requirements given to us by the user. This assignment though challenging, helped reaffirm the purpose and value of the 'for-loops' and condtional statements.

The following application generates a password, after notifying the user that he/she has to stay confined within 8 and 128 characters. After acquiring how many characters the user would like, the application asked whether or not the user would want numbers, upper/lower case letters and even special characters. A new password is then displayed on the screen for the user to use.
